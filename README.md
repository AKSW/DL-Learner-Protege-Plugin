# DL-Learner Protégé Plugin
A Protégé plugin for the DL-Learner framework

## Requirements

The current plugin only works with Protégé 4.3 and newer.

## Usage
 * choose a class in the class hierarchy view
 * depending on whether you want to search for equivalent class or a super class expressions, i.e. click on the corresponding Add-button (+)
 * choose the DL-Learner tab in the new dialog
 * click on the 'suggest equivalent class expressions' (or 'suggest super class expressions') button to start the learning process
 * during algorithm runtime, the list of suggested class expressions will periodically be updated
 * once the learning has been finsihed, you can choose the appropriate class expression(s) and click on the 'Add' button to add them to the current ontology
